London’s Remaim. 7

- Dear Maec, said he, walk the aad Round, and turn
Thy tender Bosome to an Urn ;
Hide there the Sacred Dust: so we repair
The Bird that to himself is Heir:
And so shall Lohnoh from its Ruines spring,
And thou shalt its Good-morrow sing.
The Muse obey'd3 but walking burnt her foot ;
(Her limping Verse to that impute :)· '-
Sad was thelsight ; yet thishhihe saidhhe,
Poem and Su-bject both agree ι
. For, me thinks, whilee unequal Lines 1 payre,
Like House and Ruine matcht they are.
Her Round perform'h (sweet Madam) straight to·y0u
She crawles, with her Remarku‚ aa due. -
Yo'ur Vertue first, Relation, next, she knows‚
Concern you in the Cityes Woee:
And since she's told, [A Ladyes Hand doth Cures]
She hopes that Influence from Youra.

ENtring the City once exactly known,

Thalia found her marks were gone ι ·
whence, loath to ask her Way, for sear of danger,
(’Twas death then to he ,thought'a stranger‚)
Silent, she joyn'd her sels to every ὤτους, ’
And bade her ears supply her Τοῑιειιεε.ι
In dumb Procession thus my Muse did pass ;

And common Chat her Tutor wau.

This was, 'said some, ΡΑυιε Reverend'Edifice ;
The World did not its like comprise.
A Carved Roof its Marble Pilhars erown'd‚
