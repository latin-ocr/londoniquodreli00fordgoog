London’s Remains.

And these to that, vast Arches bound.

Its monstrous length to the unicarmed sight
The Floor‚ and Cieling did unite.

Piliars remote, approach’d, which parted, nigh 3
And each step up-hill seem’d to lye.

A Noble Porch such'd in the Western Ray,
And through th’ whole House did it display.

Whose richer Art made the Materiale vile ;
And with two Princes crown'd the Pile.

But, eo intense was the surrounding F lame,
The Marble gap'd, and looe’d the Freme.

The Roof‚ fail'd by its Proppe‚ sorc'd into th’ Earth,
To seek the Place that gave it Birth.

Now nought remains but Ruines rudely torn,
Like Cliffs which stetting Waven have worn.

' Chipp’d, like the rough-hew'd Oai, when th' Axe

doth pare
Its Trunk to an uneven Squere.
These Vaulto (said others) do St. Faith comprise :
Falce Faith! write on her, Here ohe lies.

Rich Pawns the Letter'd Tribe did there depone,
But a deceitful Guardian chose.

Like Sybylls Leaves, the scorched Learning fell,
Scatter'd by Winds too farre to teli.

There trembling Boyes rubb'd out their Author’s sense
On studione Thumbs‚¹ then suck'd it thence.

The Muses in those shops were woo'd and wonne;
But Money made the Match come on.

This learn’d3 of alt the Sacrcd Reliquen part
She grasp'd‚ and laid ’em next her Heart.
