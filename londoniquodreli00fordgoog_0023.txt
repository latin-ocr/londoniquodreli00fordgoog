London’s Rems.

A curelees Causon did the Colledg spond 3
Nor did Amen its Furyee end.

Apollo's (humil-house, said ohe, ttrite :
Dark Caeco need a Clubb of Eyes.

A lofty Pile, (now humbled) next appears,
Once Chriet'ned ’twas Sento· Soootefloas:

Which since it felt the all-interring F lame,
The saint lost, kept its empty Name.

They tell us here of One unmelted Bell,
That toll'd Condemned Felono Knell.

This Rumour heard, hang still, said she, to do
That Worh for Lowoows Fhoxos too.

Thus, Weotward plac'd‚ She view'd the Wtooenw
Towtt
Glad by its Tops it might be known:
And, (Englende Gloryes) 1 congratulate

To you, (She said) your better Fate.
There stands Saint Petet’s Shrine: Next‚ that,
wherein

What denies Princes Godo, io seen.
And there's the House where wisest Heado decreedt

And th' Haeo where nimblest Tongues are fee'd.
And there’s wantum, a Noble pile, although
Its Royal Owner much below.
1 joy you both, (may both Joyes lasting be)
of Thoe, thy Master‚ of thy Mater, thee.

Her Face once turn'd, she now beholdo an Heap,
Where stood a Street‚ misnamed Cuneo.
Here once a gloriou‘t Aqueduct did ahino,
Where Triumpho Water turn'd to Wine.
