London’s Romaim. 17

Dear Birtha, (said She) of my once-teeming Throwes‚
Now Parente of my loeting Woeo!

Unhappy mame, in which devoured lye
Th’ Ashee of all Antiquity!

No other losse disdoineth Timeo repair:
But This, ie Times and my despair.

Next Gonu-Hier, once, on Marble Piliam stood,
Pilius, too proud of such a Load.

Two ermed Giants were ite constant Guard,
Whiles thither peaceful Gowne repair’d.

Here, a grave Senate Causes did debete,
Which the Lord Mayor adjodg’d in State.

But lawleee Flentes adjourn'd the Court from thence,
'Gainst which its Guarde were no defence. »
But, Rise, (said She) more stateiy from thine Urn,

And may the banisht Court return.

The next advance unto her mind did bring Α
The Charine of an harmonious Ring.

The bended Bow ehot thence reflected munds,
Made up of Musiche beet Compounde.

Ite Courfeu-Bell once flames in order kept ;
And rak'd up Fire till morning slept.

The Bow dieerm'd‚ in vain now ecar’d the Flame,
And the ehrill Metal dumb became.

Yet Vulcnn, triumph not, (said She) for thou
Shalt rearrn the disarmed Bow.

Her next Advance the Rom Crrnnor presente,
Where Gnrsrrnn thus She complements.
