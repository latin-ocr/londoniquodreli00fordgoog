Haile‚ Flumee Survive13 though thy Nuble Pile
Be hurnt (nid She, and wept the while>

Thy Gmhopper (turn'd Cricket now) shall sing
A welcome to ite second spring.

. Mean while, thiu to thy'Memory is due,

For one Chauge meant, thou built’ut us two.

The Rom. Sumus miss'd3 her Memory,

Their Chronicle did thus supply.

Firut, the Couuussou left a doubtful Crown‚
Which Hunouu unat'ch'd, and soon laid down,

The Nouum Prize: whom dead, his Caen deny'd.
For th' Han, the Hunter‚ ervs, dy'd.

Το Beauclerh Huunu Lampreys fatal were.
Th' Emp'ress, was Suuuuuus Leve, and F ear.

Fair Rosamuud did Second Huuuu charm.
And L1ou-Huhuu, the Lamb did Arm.

To Jouu‚ the Monk a deadly Wussaile clears.
Third Huuxu’s Barons prov'd hie Peers ε

F iret Enwuuu, first the Welsh and S'cot did quell.
Spitted to d'eath Next Enwuuu fell.

The qu pay'd Frauce her Conquest back.

Sixth Ham onee lost France, und Eugland twice.
Both lowen were Fourth Enwunu’s rise.

Fifth Eomn wau a Kiug; but for his Crown
His chle Ducx pay'd him in Down.

The eeveuth Huuuu weda the Rival Rose.
The Emm, Romes Rival Power 0'rethrows. '
