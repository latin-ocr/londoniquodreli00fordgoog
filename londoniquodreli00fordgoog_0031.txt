' Londotr’s Remains. 21

Sixth Enwuno eerly ripe, did early rot.

A bloody Reign did Mnrr blot.
Pence, Plenty, Piety, the Vruonr famer.

Religion, Perre, and Learning, Jnuns.
A Martyrr Name First Cnnnnrr alone doth bear
May [Merciful] the Sucouo wear.

The dreadful Wrack now-all together flingrr
Crownr, Sceptern and the Trunkr of Kingr.
And, like your statues, Kingr, said She, you murt
Once mingled be with common Durt.

But, Hervenr, Cornutus hin Fate delayl may rlow
Artive his Age, and rlower go.

Moy he hir Fatherr in new Marble care r
And late with'r F othere take hin place.

And you, who dream’t o'th’ Frll of Kings‚ at laet
Grow wire, now Sixty-Six is part.

Corne off (at least) like Oracler3 and' ray,
Your Credit'r rav’d3 There Kings are they.

Mures love rtreanrr. Whence prompted by Lover
Firer,
How fares the Themes! mine, next enquiret.
On Arehed Stone a Noble Fronte here stood
To wed Two Towns‚ and check the Flooct
lte lofty Tope with Princely Buildinge crown'd‚
'Midrt anee stood ar on rolid Ground. -
But oft the torring Tydes arrry¹d‚ in vain,
To break the Adamantine Chain.

This Vulctn heard, and, Grieved Floodr, (naid He)

Your Liberty receive from Me.
