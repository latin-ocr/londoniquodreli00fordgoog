London's Remains. 27

Nigh, ΟιεεΗΑΜ-Οοιιεαε stood ; and (which io more)
Yet stands, though Ruine knock'd at door.

Apollo and the Nine‚ oft here resort 3
And Helicon's the thinner Court.

Here learned Lectores on all Themeo are read ;
And Atto endow’d, Professoro wed.

Philosophers here govern Eorth and Skieo;
And Kings Themselves Philosophize.

The F ellowohip a Royal Title wears:
But things beyond their Title‚ dares.

Old Mastero here are school’d again 3 and must
Now learn byTrial, not by Trust.

Here, Nature's Cabinet is, expos'd to sight ;
And all her Shop held up to light.

Here, in a Tube, the armed F lea doth bear
Death on the point of’s dreadful Spear: ,

And he that feels it, (whiles he sees it such)
Believeo his Eye before his Touch.

Here, he that views the Native of his Head,
Dioclaimo the Monster that he bred:

And from th' Hair-Clubb his Armed Paw doth wield,
The place in which it grew, doth shield.

But, these are small things. It's much, that the Skye
Where Thought ne're pierc'd‚ admits the Eye.

White Rocks‚ the Moon, a second Albion make 3
And that’s a Sea, which was a Brake.

Sol’s soce now, Ladyes, Beauty-patcheo wearo,
And Saturn'o like a Pot with Euro.

Yeu, Jove, and's Guord‚ and Heaveno mogo-Anus,
Warr’s God‚ aod Venus with her Charmo ι
