London's Remains. Ι e9

Eech, in a norrow Gleee etrnnge eighte diepleye ι
And stertente known, as well ee Fleuo.
Yet, Thou, whose greater Mind th' old World ont-
grew,
Might’et here each Night deeery e New ι
Though thot would grieve thee too, except the wey
To th’ New Worlde were ae known ee They.
'Tio much, thet Ayre it oelf in Seelee is weigh’d 3
And Scalee by emelleet'Atomee ewey'd.
Thet lawleee Sene new Lewe of Motion know,
And by letrn’d Mentores ebb end flow.
That the Oceon’e rendred fathomeble, and
Abyese, for ι tneer Neme doth otend.
Thet from the Brlny Pond new Buckete fill'd,
Excluding salt, freeh water yield.
That summer-snow (the'yeor invented) coolee
Th’ offeneive hent of fleming Bowlee. -
That Water’t herden’d to an Earthy Men,
And Eerth dissolves to whtt It wne.
Thet Time more eure doth by vibration run,
And tenentum-watenes tet the Son.
Yee, shortly, Timber shall the Fite repell‚
When ceneted with a Merble ehell.
What pity 'twas² th' Invention came too late
Theee Ruineo to enticipate!
For then hed Lonoon been fleme-proof ; nor hed
My Museo subject been eo fad.
He too, thet sung chang'd shepee, might hence enrich
Hie Mne, without e God or witch.
Here, empty’d Veins with blood adopted ewell,
And Souls in Foreign Bodiee dwell.
Whence young juyce shortly wither'd Limbe shall fill.
