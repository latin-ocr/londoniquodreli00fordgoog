And Time remounr the passed Hili.

Yea, hestenecl Age shall Childhoods Neighbour grow.
Audon the downy Chin shall rnow.

Pylrdes shsll into his Friend be turn’d,
And he himself to him resours'd:

So thet, when one must dye, the Feres shsll be
Puzled t'unriddle which is He.

Yea, bcrking Lambs their ssutt'ring Tsyler shall rear,
And bleating Dogs their Pertures sherr.

The neighing·Asse shall rt the Drumme rejoyce,
And hoarse shall be the Horres Voyce.

Tspp the Eagle into Mun, and ’ris presum’d
Smooth Ganymed will soon be plum'd:

And Icarus with native Wings shall llye,
Where borrow’d Plurnes in vain did try.

In summe: A thousand Wonders here do dwell,
Too great for my poor verse to tell.

The College stands, but in its vissge beers

· The merke that justifie its fears.

This seen ς 1 thrnl thee, Vulcan, (said the Mure)
This Plecds thy former Franks excuse.

Hence, sll the envy'd Fragments thet remrein,
Her searching Eye doth entertain.

Some liclr’d by scorching Flames, discolour'd were ;
Where Ruine only wrote, [How near !]

Others entire, (though once alilre resign’d)
Their Lords, restor’d with profit, srud.

But maire not others Losse, your Gaius, (She ruys)
oppression, Mercy ill repays.

The Flames from you received not their Pay,
But Hesvens Commission did obey.
